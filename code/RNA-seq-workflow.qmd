Below is a general workflow for the processing and analysis of an RNA-seq dataset. 

Code chunks below were implemented on the UCR HPCC cluster.

# Data Preparation

## Obtain SRA sample list
For this demo, we will use a publicly available dataset from the [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) (SRA) hosted at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). To download the demo dataset, we will obtain a SRA sample list containing information for a BioProject stored in the SRA database using the BioProject ID: PRJNA950346.

We will first use the following shell script to obtain information about the BioProject.

```{r}
system2()
```
